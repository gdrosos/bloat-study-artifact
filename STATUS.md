# Artifact Status

This document outlines the badges we are applying for in relation to our artifact accompanying the paper "Bloat beneath Pythonâ€™s Scales: A Fine-Grained Inter-Project Dependency Analysis," accepted at FSE'24.

## Applied Badges

- **Available**: 
  - Our artifact is permanently available in a public GitHub repository and has been assigned a DOI via Zenodo for persistent archival.
  - Zenodo DOI: [10.5281/zenodo.xxxxx](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.xxxxx)
  - GitHub Repository: [https://github.com/gdrosos/bloat-study-artifact](https://github.com/gdrosos/bloat-study-artifact)

- **Evaluated - Functional**: 
  - The artifact includes comprehensive documentation, guiding users through the setup and execution of the provided scripts.
  - The results and data included are consistent with those presented in the paper.
  - The artifact package is complete with all necessary components readily available or can be generated using the provided scripts.

- **Evaluated - Reusable**: 
  - We have adhered to community norms and standards in documenting and structuring our artifact, ensuring that other researchers can easily understand and reuse it.
  - Detailed instructions are provided for both the Docker container setup and the native Ubuntu/Debian environment.
  - Recognizing the significant time commitment required to replicate the full experiments, we also offer a scaled-down version of the methodology. Specifically, we offer the opportunity to work with a subset of the data and complete the process in about ~30 minutes. This option is designed to help users quickly understand the key processes, including fetching the dataset, resolving dependencies, and generating call graphs, without the lengthy duration typically required for the full experiments.
